**SAM_Multitasker** is part of the **SAM (Sustainable Analytical Model) Toolkit** —  
an open-source collection of tools designed to help engineers create, manage,
and process analytical building models for energy and environmental analysis.

This repository provides **scenario orchestration and task execution utilities**
that enable SAM simulations to be configured and executed
**in series or in parallel**.

It supports the creation, scheduling, and coordination of multiple simulation scenarios,
allowing analytical workflows to be automated and scaled efficiently
across different models, parameters, and simulation engines.

Welcome — and let’s keep the open-source journey going. 🤝
